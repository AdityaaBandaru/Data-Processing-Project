# Data-Processing-Project
This repository contains a complete data preprocessing pipeline built using Python. It includes handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and splitting the dataset for training and testing. This is a foundational step in any machine learning workflow.

📌 Features
Handling missing values using most frequent strategy

One-hot encoding of categorical features

Label encoding of target variable

Train-test splitting

Standardization of numerical columns using StandardScaler

🛠 Technologies Used
Python

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-Learn (sklearn)

Matplotlib (for optional visualization)

📂 Files
data_processing.py: Contains the preprocessing pipeline
